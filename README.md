## geometries

"Geometries" is mainly a JavaScript project for writing a drawing compiler to generate complicated geometries. Inspired by [the project](https://github.com/aleen42/FuncDrawCompiler) written before with C Sharp, and UI rendered by WPF, I hope it can be also completed as a module in JavaScript. Furthermore, vector graphics can also be an awesome feature especially when a designer hopes to use programs to generate into what they are similar to.
